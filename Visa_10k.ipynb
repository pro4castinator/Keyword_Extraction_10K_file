The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2019 reflects continued global consumer spending growth amidst uneven global economic conditions. The increase over the prior year was primarily driven by higher personnel and marketing as we continue to invest in growing our business, offset by a lower litigation provision. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a reduction to the conversion rate of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $71 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income increased by $121 million.

We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants as well as establishing and earning these fees. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current quarter’s pricing applied to the prior quarter’s payments volume. Client incentives consist of incentives provided in contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to grow payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance, win merchant routing transactions over our network and drive innovation. Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Litigation provision represents litigation expenses and is based on management’s understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss. 39\n",

Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. See Note 9—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. There were no borrowings under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2019. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity, we do not rely on them for other operational needs. We expect a decision by the district court in the first half of calendar year 2020. The funds in the U.S. litigation escrow account as well as the $467 million takedown payments that we expect to be returned will be available for settlement with these opt-out merchants. See Note 14—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. During fiscal 2019, we declared and paid $2.3 billion in dividends. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. Additional amounts may be agreed with the UK pension plan trustees. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2019, due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives.

For the year ended September 30, 2019, client incentives represented 21% of gross revenues.

For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $71 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income increased by $121 million. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a reduction to the conversion rate of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Tax Act’s reduction of the corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $1.1 billion. Net of related tax benefit of $56 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $96 million. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a non-recurring foreign exchange gain of $145 million, before tax, in other non-operating income as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore has no impact on our reported income tax provision. (2) \n",

Additionally, in June 2018, we deposited $600 million of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2018 have been completed. Growth on a constant-dollar basis was not significantly different from the nominal-dollar basis growth rate for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017(1). Therefore, service revenues reported for the 12 months ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally.

            "Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 and 2017 was impacted by continued growth in our underlying business. See Note 2—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 17—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Sources of Liquidity\n",
            "Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. The remaining non-current investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date; however, they are also generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. We had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2018. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. The redemption was funded with the net proceeds from the new fixed-rate senior notes issued in September 2017. We hold approximately $7.6 billion of available liquidity globally as of September 30, 2018, in the form of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle. This will increase our taxable income, thereby increasing our taxes to be paid. As of September 30, 2018, we had remaining authorized funds of $4.2 billion. We expect to pay approximately $574 million in connection with this dividend on December 4, 2018. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States. Additional amounts may be agreed with the UK pension plan trustees. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2018, due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. As of September 30, 2018, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $15.0 billion of assets and $22 million of liabilities. None of these instruments were valued using significant unobservable inputs. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. (3) \n",
            "Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from less than one year to twenty years. Amount presented was converted to U.S. dollar at the September 30, 2018 exchange rate. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. For the year ended September 30, 2018, client incentives represented 21% of gross operating revenues. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n",
            "We are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are they expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2018 and 2017 were $5.1 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $206 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $35 million in pension cost.\n",

currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions.', 'In general, during fiscal 2018, we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital.', 'Our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of $931 million.', 'We hold approximately $7.6 billion of available liquidity globally as of September 30, 2018, in the form of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle.', 'U.S. covered litigation.', 'We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the U.S. covered litigation.', 'As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are payable from the U.S. litigation escrow account.', 'During fiscal 2018, we deposited $600 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation, and made $150 million covered litigation payments that were funded from the U.S. litigation escrow account.', 'At September 30, 2018, the U.S. litigation escrow account had an available balance of $1.5 billion.', 'In September 2018, Visa and other defendants entered into a new settlement agreement with plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation purporting to represent a class of plaintiffs seeking monetary damages, which superseded and amended the 2012 Settlement Agreement.', 'The proposed settlement amount is approximately $6.2 billion.', 'Our share represents approximately $4.1 billion, the majority of which will be satisfied through funds previously deposited with the court plus the $600 million we deposited into its litigation escrow account in June 2018.', 'No additional funds are required for this class settlement.', 'Our share is covered under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which was created to insulate Visa and our class A common shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases.', 'Until the court approves the 2018 Settlement Agreement, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to resolve the damages class plaintiffs’ claims as contemplated by that agreement.', 'If the 2018 Settlement Agreement is terminated and no further agreement is reached regarding funds previously paid from the litigation escrow account into court-supervised settlement funds, we will have the right to the majority of these funds, which would be returned to the U.S. litigation escrow account.', 'This will increase our taxable income, thereby increasing our taxes to be paid.', 'See Note 2—U.S.', 'and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 17—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'Other litigation.', 'Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the U.S. covered litigation, including VE territory covered litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceeding, could give rise to future liquidity needs.', 'Reduction in as-converted shares.', 'During fiscal 2018, share repurchases and escrow deposits reduced as-converted class A common stock by 63 million at an average price of $124.38 per share.', 'Of the 63 million shares, 58 million were repurchased in the open market using $7.2 billion of cash on hand.', 'Additionally, we deposited $600 million of operating cash into the U.S. litigation escrow account previously established under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan.', 'The deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our Class A common stock because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count.', 'See Note 2—U.S.', 'and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 11—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', '47\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIn January 2018, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for $7.5 billion.', 'This authorization has no expiration date.', 'As of September 30, 2018, we had remaining authorized funds of $4.2 billion.', 'All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2018 have been completed.', 'See Note 11—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'Dividends.', 'During fiscal 2018, we declared and paid $1.9 billion in dividends.', 'On October 16, 2018, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.25 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series B and C preferred stock on an as-converted basis).', 'We expect to pay approximately $574 million in connection with this dividend on December 4, 2018.', 'See Note 11—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors.', 'All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends.', 'Pension and other postretirement benefits.', 'We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States.', 'As a result of the acquisition of Visa Europe, we assumed the obligations related to Visa Europe’s defined benefit plan, primarily consisting of the UK pension plans.', 'Our policy with respect to our U.S. qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in September of each year, an amount not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.', 'Our U.S. non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis.', 'In relation to the Visa Europe UK pension plans, our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our UK pension plans.', 'Additional amounts may be agreed with the UK pension plan trustees.', 'In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we made contributions to our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $3 million, $12 million and $4 million, respectively.', 'For Visa Europe’s UK pension plans, we made contributions of $11 million, $5 million and $102 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, subsequent to the acquisition date as agreed upon with the trustees to improve the funding level of the plans.', 'In fiscal 2019, given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans and Visa Europe’s UK defined benefit pension plans by approximately $3 million and $10 million, respectively.', 'The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences.', 'See Note 7—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'Capital expenditures.', 'Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2018, due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives.', 'We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives.', 'Acquisitions.', 'In February 2017, we acquired a business using $302 million of cash on hand, primarily reflecting total purchase price less cash received.', 'The acquisition will help Visa’s clients and merchant partners accelerate digital commerce.', 'On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe.', 'In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition.', 'See Note 5—Intangible Assets and Goodwill to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'Fair Value Measurements—Financial Instruments\\nThe assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.', 'Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability.', 'As of September 30, 2018, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $15.0 billion of assets and $22 million of liabilities.', 'None of these instruments were valued using significant unobservable inputs.', 'See Note 3—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications.', 'Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed and reflected in our contractual obligations table below.', '48\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndemnifications\\nWe indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules.', 'The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time.', 'We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met.', 'See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients and partners under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement.', 'Contractual Obligations\\nOur contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity.', 'The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2018.', 'We believe that we will be

liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.4 billion as of September 30, 2018.', 'At September 30, 2018, we had also accrued $99 million of interest and $34 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions.', 'We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions.', 'Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table.', '(8) \\nWe evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension

balance sheet related to these arrangements.', '49\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported.', 'See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period.', 'However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.', 'We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.', 'Revenue Recognition—Client Incentives\\nCritical estimates.', 'We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation.', 'These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses.', 'We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met.', 'The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management’s ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred.', 'Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit.', 'Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management’s estimate of each client’s performance.', 'These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.', 'Assumptions and judgment.', 'Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume, card issuance and card conversion.', 'Performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners.', 'Impact if actual results differ from assumptions.', 'If actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded.', 'Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues.', 'As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.', 'The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable.', 'For the year ended September 30, 2018, client incentives represented 21% of gross operating revenues.', 'Legal and Regulatory Matters\\nCritical estimates.', 'We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time.', 'Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements.', 'Assumptions and judgment.', 'We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party.', 'We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.', 'Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a potential loss is reasonably estimable.', 'Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel.', 'As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates.', 'Our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation.', 'The plan’s mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account.', 'The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account\\n\\n50\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nbalance.', 'We recorded an additional accrual of $600 million for U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2018.', 'Our Europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers Visa Europe territory covered litigation (and resultant

judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.', 'See Note 17—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'Income Taxes\\nCritical estimates.', 'In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions.', 'Assumptions and judgment.', 'We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.', 'We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities.', 'Impact if actual results differ from assumptions.', 'Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates.', 'Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities.', 'If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.', 'ITEM 7A.', 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\\nMarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors.', 'Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices.', 'Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis.', 'Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\\nWe are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies.', 'We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated non-functional currency denominated cash flows.', 'Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements.', 'The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $3.7 billion and $3.1 billion at September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.', 'The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2018 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold.', 'However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast.', 'The effect of a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value gain of approximately $280 million or loss of approximately $350 million, respectively, on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2018.', 'See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9—Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe.', 'On the third anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe transaction, we will pay an additional purchase consideration of €1.0 billion, plus 4.0% compounded annual interest.', 'As such, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against the euro.', 'A hypothetical 10% decline in the U.S. dollar against the euro, compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2018, would increase the deferred purchase consideration liability by $130 million, including interest.', '51\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nWe are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as the functional currency of Visa Europe is the euro.', 'Translation from the euro to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period.', 'Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets.', 'A hypothetical 10% change in the euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2018, would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of $2.0 billion.', 'We designate a portion of our euro-denominated deferred consideration liability as a net investment hedge against a portion of the foreign exchange rate exposure of our net investment of $18.8 billion in Visa Europe as of September 30, 2018.', 'Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to a change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation of the Company’s net investment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.', 'See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9—Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities.', 'This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions.', 'Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties.', 'Interest Rate Risk\\nOur investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities.', 'These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments.', 'Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk.', 'The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates.', 'Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income.', 'Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity.', 'Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are they expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates.', 'The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2018 and 2017 were $5.1 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively.', 'A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately $31 million on our investment securities at September 30, 2018.', 'The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $3.5 billion and $1.8 billion at September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.', 'Pension Plan Risk\\nAt September 30, 2018 and 2017, our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.1 billion at each year end, and projected benefit obligations were $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively.', 'A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding.', 'A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $206 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $35 million in pension cost.', 'At September 30, 2018 and 2017, our

credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment.', 'Commercial paper program.', 'We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes.', 'Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance.', 'We had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2018.', 'See Note 6—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'Credit facility.', 'We have an unsecured $4.0 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) which expires on January 27, 2022.', 'There were no borrowings under the credit facility as of

2021.', 'U.S.', 'Litigation escrow account.', 'Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a U.S. litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable.', 'When we fund the U.S. litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock.', 'In June 2018, we deposited $600 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation.', 'See Note 2—U.S.', 'and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 17—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'The balance in this account at September 30, 2018, was $1.5 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets.', 'As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity, we do not rely on them for other operational needs.', 'Long-term debt.', 'In September 2017, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion, with maturities ranging between 5 and 30 years.', 'In October 2017, we redeemed all of the $1.75 billion principal amount outstanding of the 2017 Notes.', 'The redemption was funded with the

strategy.', 'We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded.', 'If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets.', 'Uses of Liquidity\\nPayments settlement.', 'Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement.', 'Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions.', 'In general, during fiscal 2018, we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital.', 'Our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of $931 million.', 'We hold approximately $7.6 billion of available liquidity globally as of September 30, 2018, in the form of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle.', 'U.S. covered litigation.', 'We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the U.S. covered litigation.', 'As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are payable from the U.S. litigation escrow account.', 'During fiscal 2018, we deposited $600 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation, and made $150 million covered litigation payments that were funded from the U.S. litigation escrow account.', 'At September 30, 2018, the U.S. litigation escrow account had an available balance of $1.5 billion.', 'In September 2018, Visa and other defendants entered into a new settlement agreement with plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation purporting to represent a class of plaintiffs seeking monetary damages, which superseded and amended the 2012 Settlement Agreement.', 'The proposed settlement amount is approximately $6.2 billion.', 'Our share represents approximately $4.1 billion, the majority of which will be satisfied through funds previously deposited with the court plus the $600 million we deposited into its litigation escrow account in June 2018.', 'No additional funds are required for this class settlement.', 'Our share is covered under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which was created to insulate Visa and our class A common shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases.', 'Until the court approves the 2018 Settlement Agreement, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to resolve the damages class plaintiffs’ claims as contemplated by that agreement.', 'If the 2018 Settlement Agreement is terminated and no further agreement is reached regarding funds previously paid from the litigation escrow account into court-supervised settlement funds, we will have the right to the majority of these funds, which would be returned to the U.S. litigation escrow account.', 'This will increase our taxable income, thereby increasing our taxes to be paid.', 'See Note 2—U.S.', 'and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 17—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'Other litigation.', 'Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the U.S. covered litigation, including VE territory covered litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceeding, could give rise to future liquidity needs.', 'Reduction in as-converted shares.', 'During fiscal 2018, share repurchases and escrow deposits reduced as-converted class A common stock by 63 million at an average price of $124.38 per share.', 'Of the 63 million shares, 58 million were repurchased in the open market using $7.2 billion of cash on hand.', 'Additionally, we deposited $600 million of operating cash into the U.S. litigation escrow account previously established under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan.', 'The deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our Class A common stock because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count.', 'See Note 2—U.S.', 'and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 11—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', '47\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIn January 2018, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for $7.5 billion.', 'This authorization has no

11—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'Dividends.', 'During fiscal 2018, we declared and paid $1.9 billion in dividends.', 'On October 16, 2018, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.25 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series B and C preferred stock on an as-converted basis).', 'We expect to pay approximately $574 million in connection with this dividend on December 4, 2018.', 'See

postretirement benefits.', 'We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States.', 'As a result of the acquisition of Visa Europe, we assumed the obligations related to Visa Europe’s defined benefit plan, primarily consisting of the UK pension plans.', 'Our policy with respect to our U.S. qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in September of each year, an amount not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.', 'Our U.S. non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis.', 'In relation to the Visa Europe UK pension plans, our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our UK pension plans.', 'Additional amounts may be agreed with the UK pension plan trustees.', 'In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we made contributions to our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $3 million, $12 million and $4 million, respectively.', 'For Visa Europe’s UK pension plans, we made contributions of $11 million, $5 million and $102 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, subsequent to the acquisition date as agreed upon with the trustees to improve the funding level of the plans.', 'In fiscal 2019, given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans and Visa Europe’s UK defined benefit pension plans by approximately $3 million and $10 million, respectively.', 'The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences.', 'See Note 7—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'Capital expenditures.', 'Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2018, due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives.', 'We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives.', 'Acquisitions.', 'In February 2017, we acquired a business using $302 million of cash on hand, primarily reflecting total purchase price less cash received.', 'The acquisition will help Visa’s clients and merchant partners accelerate digital commerce.', 'On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe.', 'In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition.', 'See Note 5—Intangible Assets and Goodwill to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'Fair Value Measurements—Financial Instruments\\nThe assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.', 'Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability.', 'As of September 30, 2018, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $15.0 billion of assets and $22 million of liabilities.', 'None of these instruments were valued using significant unobservable inputs.', 'See Note 3—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications.', 'Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed and reflected in our contractual obligations table below.', '48\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndemnifications\\nWe indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules.', 'The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time.', 'We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk,

generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported.', 'See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period.', 'However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.', 'We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.', 'Revenue Recognition—Client Incentives\\nCritical estimates.', 'We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation.', 'These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses.', 'We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met.', 'The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management’s ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred.', 'Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit.', 'Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management’s estimate of each client’s performance.', 'These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.', 'Assumptions and judgment.', 'Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume, card issuance and card conversion.', 'Performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners.', 'Impact if actual results differ from assumptions.', 'If actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded.', 'Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues.', 'As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.', 'The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable.', 'For the year ended September 30, 2018, client incentives represented 21% of gross operating revenues.', 'Legal and Regulatory Matters\\nCritical estimates.', 'We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time.', 'Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements.', 'Assumptions and judgment.', 'We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party.', 'We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.', 'Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a potential loss is reasonably estimable.', 'Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel.', 'As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates.', 'Our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation.', 'The plan’s mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow

rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions.', 'Assumptions and judgment.', 'We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.', 'We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities.', 'Impact if actual results differ from assumptions.', 'Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates.', 'Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities.', 'If one or

adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.', 'ITEM 7A.', 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\\nMarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors.', 'Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices.', 'Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis.', 'Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\\nWe are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies.', 'We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated non-functional currency denominated cash flows.', 'Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements.', 'The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $3.7 billion and $3.1 billion at September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.', 'The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2018 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold.', 'However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast.', 'The effect of a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value gain of approximately $280 million or loss of approximately $350 million, respectively, on our foreign currency forward

closing of the Visa Europe transaction, we will pay an additional purchase consideration of €1.0 billion, plus 4.0% compounded annual interest.', 'As such, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against the euro.', 'A hypothetical 10% decline in the U.S. dollar against the euro, compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2018, would increase the deferred purchase consideration liability by $130 million, including interest.', '51\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nWe are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as the

consolidated balance sheets.', 'A hypothetical 10% change in the euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2018, would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of $2.0 billion.', 'We designate a portion of our euro-denominated deferred consideration liability as a net investment hedge against a portion of the foreign exchange rate exposure of our net investment of $18.8 billion in Visa Europe as of September 30, 2018.', 'Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to a change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation of the Company’s net investment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Company’s consolidated balance

Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.', 'We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities.', 'This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions.', 'Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties.', 'Interest Rate Risk\\nOur investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities.', 'These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments.', 'Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk.', 'The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates.', 'Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income.', 'Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity.', 'Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are they expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates.', 'The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2018 and 2017 were $5.1 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively.', 'A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of
